* Added possibility to mock 'alert' and 'confirm' modal dialogs
* $$.should-methods can check multiple conditions

 $$("#multirowTable tr").shouldHave(size(2))
    .filterBy(text("Norris")).shouldHave(size(1));

===== Usability issues:
* Readable error messages!
* Save screenshots into subfolders: folder name is "com/package/TestClass/", file name is "testName.png"/"testName.html"

* Method $.setValue() triggers 'change' events in IE too
* Updated to selenium-java:2.31.0

=== 2.1 (Released 2.04.2013)
* Changed license from GPL 1.0 to LGPL 3.0
* Added support for TestNG
* Added support for Selenium FluentWait API
* Added support for Selenium Actions API
* Added method $.findAll() returning list of matching elements.
* Added method $$.findBy
* Added method $$.shouldHave(texts("A", "B", "C")) for asserting texts of all matching elements
* Added method $.data(attr) as a synonym for $.getAttribute("data-" + attr)
* Added conditions "name", "not", "type", "id": $("#username").shouldHave(name("firstName"))
* text and exactText conditions are case insensitive (reason - in css designer can apply text transformations and tests will fail)
* introduced textCaseSensitive and exactTextCaseSensitive conditions
* added open methods to Selenide class that return page object by class
* Methods $.selectOption and $.selectOptionByValue trigger change event when possible.
* Class ElementsCollection now contains list of SelenideElements (instead of WebElements).
* Removed deprecated condition "haveText". Use $.shouldHave(text("john")) instead.
* Excluded org.webbit, netty, selenium-iphone-driver, selenium-safari-driver from Selenide dependencies to avoid loading too much useless stuff unless it's really needed.
* Now Condition implements Predicate<WebElement>. So it can be used for filtering collections.

=== 2.0 (Released 3.03.2013)
* Drop deprecated classes and methods (DOM, Navigation).
* Updated to selenium-java:2.31.0
* Selenide 2.0 is not backward-compatible with Selenide 1.+
  Migration guide:
  * import static com.codeborne.selenide.WebDriverRunner.{browser,holdBrowserOpen,remote,startMaximized,reportsFolder}
    * replace by import static com.codeborne.selenide.Configuration.*
  * import static com.codeborne.selenide.DOM.defaultWaitingTimeout
    * replace by import static com.codeborne.selenide.Configuration.*
  * import static com.codeborne.selenide.DOM.*
    * replace by import static com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.*
  * import static com.codeborne.selenide.Navigation.*
    * replace by import static com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open
  * import com.codeborne.selenide.ShouldableWebElement
    * replace by import com.codeborne.selenide.SelenideElement

=== 1.11 (Released 28.02.2013)
* Mark classes DOM and Navigation as deprecated (going to drop them in Selenide 2.0). The point is that now user only needs to import one class Selenide.
* Added support for PhantomJS driver
* Suppress HtmlUnit useless warnings
* Method $.setValue() triggers onchange event with standard JavaScript instead of jQuery.
* Condition "empty" checks for both text and value.
* Added condition "exactText".
* Moved jquery-specific workarounds to a separate class JQuery
* Added selector "by" as a synonym for "byAttribute"
* Updated to selenium-java:2.30.0

=== 1.10 (Released 11.02.2013)
* Excluded HtmlUnit dependencies. These have too large size, and not everyone uses them.
* Added method $$().shouldHaveSize(n)
* Added methods $.exists(), isDisplayed(), $.text(), $.pressEnter(), $.followLink()
* Added methods $.selectOption(), $.selectOptionByValue(), $.getSelectedValue(), $.getSelectedText()
* Changed behaviour of methods byText() and withText(): now spaces in text are ignored
* Added method $.val(String) as an alternative for $.setValue(String) (opa JQuery style!)
* Added methods $.waitUntil() and $.waitWhile()
* Added method Selectors.byAttribute(name, value)
* Added Conditions appear, readonly and attribute(String)
* Added method switchTo() for easier supporting frames
* Method open() can use either absolute or relative URL
* Added method toWebElement() returning the original WebElement
* Added annotation BrowserStrategy
* Methods assertElement, assertVisible, assertHidden in DOM are deprecated.
* Renamed ShouldableWebElement to SelenideElement (shouldable still exists for compatibility)
* $$ does not implement WebElement anymore - it was useless feature.
* Now Selenide kills webdriver if it failed to close normally
* Moved useful methods to class Selenide. Class DOM will be marked as deprecated in version 1.11 and dropped in 2.0
* Updated to selenium-java:2.29.1

=== 1.9 (Released 5.01.2013)
* No need for waitFor/waitUntil methods. All the $(), getElement() and shouldXXX() methods wait for a few seconds until element appears or condition gets satisfied.
* Added support for PageObjects - see method DOM.page(Class)
* Added methods $().find() with index parameter
* Added method $().setValue()
* Added method DOM.getSelectedRadio()
* Updated to selenium-java:2.26.0

* Added support for custom WebDriver initialization by defining com.codeborne.selenide.WebDriverProvider implementation via "browser" system property.

=== 1.8 (Released 29.11.2012)
* Changed Selectors.byText() behaviour - now it matches THE WHOLE TEXT, not a substring.
* A new method Selectors.withText() has been added that matches substring.
* Added option "selenide.start-maximized" (true/false) instead of (deprecated) option "chrome.switches".
* Added support for By.CssSelector to method DOM.getJQuerySelector()
